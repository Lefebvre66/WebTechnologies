                        <p>Quantum computing uses the concept of quantum mechanics to offer a massive leap forward in
                            solving complex
                            computation problems. Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms can significantly
                            enhance
                            processing efficiency and computational speed, making them capable of guaranteeing high QoS
                            requirements of 6G networks. This talk presents the state-of-the-art in quantum machine
                            learning
                            and optimization, providing a comprehensive overview of its potential via machine learning
                            approaches.
                            Furthermore, it introduces quantum-inspired machine learning and optimization applications
                            for 6G networks
                            in terms of 6G channel estimation and RF fingerprinting, highlighting enabling technologies
                            and potential
                            challenges. Finally, it outlines key research issues and future directions for
                            quantum-inspired optimization in 6G networks.</p>
